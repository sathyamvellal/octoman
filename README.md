OctoMan v0.7
============

I love octopress for its structure and node. So I thought - why not combine the two?  

OctoMan is a yeoman-generator which straps an bare assemble.js setup along with a host of other addons to enable easy blogging, just like octopress!

### Features

* One time configuration during generation!
* Uses assemble.js at its core and that means handlebars for templating by default
* Uses less
* Deploy to github pages

### Future

* Blogging support
* UI with node-webkit (planned)
